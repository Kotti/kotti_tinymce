ChangeLog
=========

0.7.0 - 2018-03-16
------------------

- Fix compatibility with Kotti 2.x

  If present, the ``kottiimage_plugin`` for TinyMCE will be activated.

- Upgrade CodeMirror to 5.35.0

  full control over the plugins.

  your static assets instead of relying on (often outdated or incomplete)
  ``js.whatever`` packages.  It also make upgrade much easier.
